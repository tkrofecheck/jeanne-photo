	<h3>Weddings and Engagement Photography</h3>
	<p>
		Jeanne Sager Photography wedding packages are custom built based on time,
		location, and more. Digital photo gallery delivery is guaranteed within one
		month of your special day, and print packages are available. Engagement
		sessions booked in conjunction with a wedding are provided at a 25% discount
		(they can also be booked separately!). Jeanne Sager Photography believes
		that love is love is love. We are an LGBTQIA-friendly business. Set up your
